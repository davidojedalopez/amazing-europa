Hey devs, I'm looking for recommendations on **feature usage tracking software/libraries**.

The solution should, at least, allow me to:
- know how much a given feature is being used
- know which users are using a given feature
- let our business people navigate and exploit the information gathered
- be implemented in both a web and Android app

So far I'm aware of two potential candidates: [Feature Audit](https://www.featureaudit.com) and [Sales Machine](https://www.salesmachine.io). Feature Audit is still in beta, so still have to be accepted into it. 


## How do you track feature usage on your apps?

script.onload = function() {
    window.iFrameResize({}, '.liquidTag');
