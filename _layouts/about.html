  <h2>More about me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a self-taught web software developer. I graduated from a BSc. on Biomedical Engineering, but I didn't like code at the time. My first interactions with software development where during college using C++, Java, and MatLab.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you can imagine, I ended up hating software since those languages, combined with traditional school methodologies, proved harder to learn for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey started again when I worked with Python. It was much more intuitive and gratifying; I could do much more with way less effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    I got a job at Intel before graduating from college, around 2015. I managed to get in thanks to a friend's referral and my engineering skills, not specifically for my coding skills. To my surprise, the team I joined used a lot of Python for automated testing.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where my learning sky-rocketed. I had to learn and understand many things in as little time as possible; I started to learn and work better.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from what I was learning at Intel, my brother was teaching me web development with Groovy & Grails, the JVM version of Ruby on Rails. I liked it that much that I enrolled in Udacity's full-stack web development nanodegree.
  </p>
  <p>
    From there on, I've been learning and practicing non-stop. It led me to my current job at Handy, as a full-stack software developer. More recently, as a tech-lead for my team.
  </p>
  <p>
    I won't make this longer, so I'm listing technologies and trends/culture I'm very familiar with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Groovy & Grails</li>
    <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Node</li>
    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
    <li>Git</li>
    <li>Jenkins</li>
    <li>Stimulus.js</li>
    <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
    <li>DevOps</li>
  </ul>
